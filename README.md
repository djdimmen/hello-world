Simple GitHub repository

Hellooooo!

I'm new to GitHub and am excited to learn more about it. 
I have been an electrical estimator, electrical project manager, journeyman electrician,
music teacher, and opera singer, and am now trying my hand at data warehouse architecture. 
I don't think I've ever been so excited to jump into something new!

Also, I love to golf. ;)
